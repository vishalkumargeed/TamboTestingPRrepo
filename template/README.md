# Template for Tambo AI (Nextjs )
I kept in mind the idea that : 
- For a general developer they freshly need to create a next application, add authentication , add DB 
- I somwhat make their path easy by creating this template 

# Important Links

This is a deployed template , I thought if this template is not even deployable then what's the point of even creating a template . I need to target even the rookie developer.

# Things I kept in mind 
- A template is something that's not need to be complex by proving many features or confuse the suer/ developer . 
- Implemented just the core : GOOGLE OAUTH, PRISMA+ POSTGRES 
- Tambo 2 components : generative and interactive , even pass the authentication state so that tambo can deal with that ! 
- Commented out the code wherever possible .
- Took the reference from the apps/web application for the frontend (Landing Page). I though If it's tambo's template then it should looks alike TAMBO ! 
I hope this is the correct appraoch , if there need to be any change please let me know !
